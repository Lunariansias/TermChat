# TermChat 💬

Welcome to the official documentation for **TermChat!** TermChat is a lightweight, web-based chat software with a green matrix-like appearance. It was initially developed for lunars.fun/chat and later evolved into lunars.fun/termtracker/chat.

The version of TermChat open sourced is a version different from other offical instances, as it both has features from the Legacy and the TermTracker version. TermChat is designed to be basic and privacy respecting, as the IRC in a way. It includes instant messaging and basic markdown as of now, with more to be added later. TermTracker is really good at customazation and adding new features. I got image uploading working - and I still host it in the TermTracker instance. 

# Setup ⚒️

Setting up TermChat is pretty easy, it takes a really short time and 2 basic steps. The old version was old and bloated, but here - a short version:

## 1: Download the files. 

## 2: Upload it to your site inside of a directory or the public_html.

And your done! It isnt as complex as other chat systems.
